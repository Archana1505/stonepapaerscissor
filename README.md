Python Tkinter Implementation
Display buttons for the user to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Randomly generate the computer's choice.
Compare the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner.
Update and display the scores for both the user and the computer.
Display the result of each round (win, lose, or draw).
Tkinter Setup: We start by importing the necessary modules and initializing the main Tkinter window.
Global Variables: We use global variables to keep track of the user and computer scores.
Winner Function: This function displays a message box indicating the winner of the round.
Get Choice Function: This function handles the game logic:
Generates a random choice for the computer.
Compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner.
Updates the scores and calls the winner function to display the result.
Button Images: We load images for the buttons representing Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
Score Labels: We create labels to display the scores for the user and the computer.
Main Loop: We run the Tkinter main loop to keep the window open and responsive.
This program provides an interactive and fun way to play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer using a graphical interface.
